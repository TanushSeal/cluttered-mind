    <p>
Let n ∈ ℕ. Consider the alphabet {a, b} and define the language L_n to consist of all words in which the difference between the number of occurrences of a and the number of occurrences of b is divisible by n. Show that for all n, L_n is regular.

    <p>
      Consider a first-order logic specification of a formal language over the alphabet {a, b, c}, with positions in a word as the domain of discourse and unary predicates A(x), B(x), and C(x) indicating that position x contains the symbols a, b, and c, respectively. Let S(x, y) denote that y is the successor of x. Show that the language expressed by the formula: ∀x ( A(x) → ∃y ( S(x, y) ∧ B(y) ) ) is regular. Is every language definable by such a first-order formula regular? Can every regular language over {a, b, c} be expressed using such an FOL formula?

  <p> With regards to the other two questions, I have found out that the answers are going to be YES and NO respectively, But proving them will require some machinery, I will update this part later. 
  The basic outline of the proof will be   Star free -> FoL definable -> Aperiodic -> (Using Schutzenberger Theorem) Star Free. We will also have to take a look at EF games to construct the example for the other question. Please let me know if there is an easier way!!!

    <p>
      Prove that a DFA accepts an infinite language if and only if its transition graph contains a directed cycle that is both reachable from the initial state and co-reachable (i.e., some accepting state is reachable from it).
