          <p>I was shortlisted for appearing the interview for the Integreted PhD program in Mathematics at IACS, Kolkata. I appeared for the interview on June 27, 2025. The panel consisted of Professors, Dr. Alok Goswami and Dr. Mithun Mukherjee. </p>
           <p>
      The interview:
    </p>
    <p>
      AG: Please Take a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Me: Thank You, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      AG: Could You please tell us where you have done your bachelors from?
    </p>
    <p>
      Me: Institute of Mathematics and Application, Bhubaneswar
    </p>
    <p>
      AG: What topic are you comfortable with?
    </p>
    <p>
      Me: Real Analysis
    </p>
    <p>
      AG: Just Analysis<span style="margin-left: 0.16665em"></span>.<span style="margin-left: 0.16665em"></span>.<span style="margin-left: 0.16665em"></span>.<span

      He was looking for something more so I said metric spaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      AG: Do you know, when are two metrics said to be equivalent?
    </p>
    <p>
      Me: If they induce the same topology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave this version of the definition because, I had told them I had
      studied metric spaces as part of Topology.
    </p>
    <p>
      AG: Do you know of some condition which is sufficient to say that two
      metrics are equivalent?
    </p>
    <p>
      Me: If both of them are discrete metrics.
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer isn't technically wrong, but I might as well have said that
      If the metrics are exactly same. LOL! I guess, they were looking for
      this result:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Theorem:&amp;<var>&#x2061;</var></b>Let,
      <var>d</var><sub>1</sub> and <var>d</var><sub>2</sub> be two metrics on
      <var>a</var> set <var>X</var>. If there exists two real numbers
      <var>k</var><sub>1</sub> and <var>k</var><sub>2</sub><var>&gt;</var> 0
      such that
    </p>
    <p>
      <var>k</var><sub>1</sub><var>d</var><sub>1</sub>(<var>x</var>,
      <var>y</var>) <var>&le;</var> <var>d</var><sub>2</sub>(<var>x</var>,
      <var>y</var>) <var>&le;</var>
      <var>k</var><sub>2</sub><var>d</var><sub>1</sub>(<var>x</var>,
      <var>y</var>) for all <var>x</var>,<var>y</var> <var>&isin;</var>
      <var>X</var>, then the metrics <var>d</var><sub>1</sub> and
      <var>d</var><sub>2</sub> are equivalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      AG: No, but, I will give you a problem based on what you are thinking,
      go to the board.

          <p>Abstract algebra reveals deep patterns in structure, from groups to rings and beyond. Even symmetries in nature are group-theoretic!</p>
          <p>Here, I reflect on my early experiences learning algebra from Math 55a notes and how they reshaped my mathematical thinking.</p>

          <p>Teaching is not just about delivering content. It’s about building mental structures in students. That’s where APOS theory excels.</p>
          <p>This post shares my thoughts on designing instruction that goes beyond procedures to conceptual growth.</p>
